From Scheduler's responsibilties   
Report  :  
1. CPU utilization  
2. Avg weighted turnaround time 
3. Avg waiting time  
4. Standard deviation for avd wieghted TRT  

Generate :  
1. Scheduler.log
2. Scheduler.perf

Steps:
1. turnaround time (TRT) = finish time - arrival time
2. weighted turnaround time (WTA) = TRT / burst_time
3. avg WTA = Sum(WTA) / N
4. avg waiting = Sum(waiting) / N

then to calc Standard deviation of WTA:
A. calc SS = SUM((WTA - avgWTA)^2)
B. stdDev = sqrt (SS / N)

--- Scheduler.log
# at time {t} process {p} {state} arr {AT} total {burst time} remain {BT - runtime} wait {WT}
---

--- Scheduler.perf (from doc)
CPU utilization = (Total time on non idle tasks) / total time
Avg WTA = 
Avg waiting = 
Std WTA = 
---

NOTES: 

Numbers: approx to 2 decimal places
States: started, resumed, stopped, finished
TA & WTA written only at finished state
